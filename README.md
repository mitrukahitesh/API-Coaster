# API Coaster

API Coaster is a web application where users can test their APIs that work with JSON request/response body. Users can create collection of APIs and share the collection with other users using the collection code with "ADMIN" or "DEVELOPER" privilege. A developer can only be able to view and test APIs whereas an admin can modify, add, or delete too.
